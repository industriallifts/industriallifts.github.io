<p>They offer numerous models that can suit any materials handling job. Order pickers work best in warehouses that operate for library archival storage, retail applications and furniture picking. Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks. While some lifts, like body lifts, are actually pretty straightforward, a mighty suspension lift can require a lot of extra considerations, parts, and work.</p>
<p>In addition to forklifts, we rent forklift attachments, aerial lifts, pallet jacks, sweeper scrubbers, and utility vehicles.

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>This German company is arguably the best material handling organization in Europe. Masts with two, three, or even four sections allow choosing a lift height best suited to particular operations, and the free-lift feature offered on some masts (allowing the forks to raise without extending the mast) makes working in low-overhead situations much easier.
