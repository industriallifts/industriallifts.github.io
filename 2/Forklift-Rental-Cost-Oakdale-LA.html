H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years.

For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
<h2>The Evolution Of The Forklift Truck Oakdale </h2>
<p>Do not overload a lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
