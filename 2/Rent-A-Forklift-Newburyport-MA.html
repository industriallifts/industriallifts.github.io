Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>

Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort.
