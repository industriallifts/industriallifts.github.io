Service brakes shall enable the truck to develop a drawbar drag equal to a percent of the gross vehicle weight (with rated capacity load) per the second column of the table on next page, while the truck is being towed slowly in either direction. From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series order pickers are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two. An unimpeded view of loads and the surrounding area are a fundamental requirement for safe truck operation.</p>

Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>
