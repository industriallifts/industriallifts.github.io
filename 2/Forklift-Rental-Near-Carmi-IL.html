<p>Order picker forklifts enable operators to directly pick stock from aisles onto an empty pallet. Narrow Aisle Trucks greatly mitigate the risk of injuries to the operator as well as damage to property while working in tight spaces. Providing the best value in Linde forklift trucks available today, Granite Industrial Trucks, Inc. Adding a suspension lift kit to your truck is a complex procedure that involves a lot of working parts. If you're looking for a little extra clearance and bigger, badder tires for the ultimate off-road experience, this might be exactly the lift you're looking for.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
