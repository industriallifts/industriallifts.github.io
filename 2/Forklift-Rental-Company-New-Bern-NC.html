Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge. This makes the global pallet truck market fragmented in nature. A pallet jack scale or a pallet truck scale can typically lift 120 mm.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.

That's the first time more than a quarter-million units were sold in one year in North America, according to Brian Feehan, president of the Industrial Truck Association, the trade group representing lift truck manufacturers.</p>

For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.
