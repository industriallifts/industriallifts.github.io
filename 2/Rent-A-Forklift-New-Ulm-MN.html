<p>Do you want to add some ride height to your vehicle? High load carrying capacity polyurethane wheels & rollers to protect floors. Whether you need to move heavy loads in a warehouse or construction field, forklifts can safely lift objects humans cannot, making them indispensable on any job site. Standard 1910.178 covers all aspects of forklift operator training, from fuel handling and charging batteries to truck operation and maintenance.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>
