<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>

<p>Since the forklift carries the load out in front of the vehicle, there are counterweights in the back of the forklift. 34. 34 Avoidance of Duplicative Training  If an operator has previously received training in a topic specified in this section, and the training is appropriate to the truck and working conditions encountered, additional training in that topic is not required if the operator has been evaluated and found competent to operate the truck safely.</p>
