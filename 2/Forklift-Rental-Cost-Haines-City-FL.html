While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory.

<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Heavy Metal Learning is designed to provide educational content on how to operate heavy equipment; a forum for operators and industry supporters to share their knowledge; an opportunity to get out in the field; and ultimately inspiring the next generation. As with any other vehicle, trucks make statements. Braking applied with the handle in an upright and horizontal position, increases the safety of the truck while a built-in pressure relief valve protects the electric reach stacker from overloads, increasing the reliability.</p>
