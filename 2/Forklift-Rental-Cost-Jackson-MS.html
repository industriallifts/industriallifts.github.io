Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>

An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it.

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
