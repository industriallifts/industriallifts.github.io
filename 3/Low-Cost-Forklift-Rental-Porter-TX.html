<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. We offer a range of financing options for companies who need a forklift now. In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift. A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck.</p>
