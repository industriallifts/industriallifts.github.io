All Parts are Stainless Steel including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, Bearings, pins and bolts, etc. Crown offers the industry's largest platform window, which provides operators the visibility they need to safely and effectively manoeuvre up and down the warehouse aisle.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>

The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
