You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road. Riding on unfathomable volumes of industrial expertise, we are offering an extensive range of High Lift Pallet Truck.</p>

Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>The operator stands in the sideways compartment while the forklift loads on its side, making it easier to maneuver through tight spaces. Our full fleet of forklifts, cranes and hoists provide ample strength, lift height, versatility, and the performance features needed for most applications.

<p>For the development of modern Forklift Trucks, Hyster-Yale Materials plays a major role in bringing the connected device technology across the trucking industry. Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders. While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks also present a danger to those driving in them. The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required.
