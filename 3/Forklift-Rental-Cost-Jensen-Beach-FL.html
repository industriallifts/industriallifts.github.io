Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>

They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is nice to have the selection of on-line, PPT, and video training to choose from., and the additional materials and forms made setting up our forklift safety program a snap.</p>
