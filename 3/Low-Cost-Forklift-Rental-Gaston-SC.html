<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers.

Forklifts are mainly used for loading and unloading trucks and for carrying goods. Refresher training is required when there is a change in the workplace or type of truck being operated and for any operators found to be operating forklifts unsafely, those who have been involved or nearly involved in accidents or those who receive poor operation evaluations.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

<p>OSHA requires that all forklift operators' performances be evaluated at least once every three years. With more than 50 models to choose from, our forklifts are manufactured with superior quality. This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>

<h3>Industrial Forklift Gaston SC</h3>
<p>Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>However, when you purchase a used forklift, operators will already be familiar with the forklift operations and can easily take over the job. We are offering Manual Pallet Truck to our client and our product is made of good quality. Using a pressure washer comes in handy when washing lifted trucks, from applying soap using a foam cannon, to cleaning the inside of your wheel wells.</p>
<p>As for the right amount of lift, a 2-, 4-, or 6-inch lift kit (or more) will give you more clearance for driving off-road. We handle all major brands, makes, models, years and everything from an electric pallet jack to larger trucks. Both available in two- and four-wheel-drive, the 6,000-pound-capacity RT706J and 8,000-pound-capacity RT708J models utilize an 80-hp John Deere 4045 diesel engine.</p>
