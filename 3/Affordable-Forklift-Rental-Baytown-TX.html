<p>These compact truck models are suitable for material handling applications that demand high performance and travel. Operate the industrial lift truck in accordance with the training received. Rough terrain forklifts also feature multipurpose functionality - a feature that's driven by an extensive assortment of attachments and accessories, and one that continues to further broaden their usefulness across a range of industries and applications.</p>
