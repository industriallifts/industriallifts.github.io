<p>With the rise in popularity of the telehandler, the rough-terrain (RT) forklift has become the lower-cost, more-maneuverable alternative on construction sites. That's why Linde develops entirely individual order pickers based on a modular system, featuring, for example, different mast heights, working platforms, chassis sizes, and operating and control concepts.</p>
<p>Some of the conditions which may affect stability are, ground and floor conditions, grade, speed, loading (trucks equipped with attachments behave as partially loaded trucks even when operated without a load on the attachment), battery weight, dynamic and static forces, and the judgment exercised by the operator. The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team.</p>
