<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. Renting provides economical and practical solutions to reflect the changing needs of your business and helps you better adjust to any aberrations in your daily routine. Note: In order to receive your C4 Forklift Operation Certification, you must take and pass a performance evaluation given by your employer at your job site. All-terrain and off-road tires in very large sizes can be crucial for conquering particularly difficult and hazardous trails.</p>
<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>
