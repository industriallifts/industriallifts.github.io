Our team of engineers developed our EWRS-RTF series of jcb rough terrain forklift tires to be easily repaired if damaged, although we are not sure you will need to with the quality that went into our design and components.

OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
