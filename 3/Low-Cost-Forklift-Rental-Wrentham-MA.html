<h3>Forklift Handling Wrentham MA</h3>
<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>JCB - dependable performance meets exceptional value with JCB's line of rough terrain forklifts. OSHA has developed several training, compliance assistance, and health and safety recognition programs throughout its history.
