The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely.

<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher.

This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>With a body lift, clearances are increased for larger tires without the changes to suspension height or alignment angles.
