Our clients can avail from us a qualitative range of Hydraulic Pallet Truck. Lifted cars can be dangerous, especially if you're driving behind them. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision.</p>
<p>Scissor lifts provide access for people or equipment to height-restricted areas (up to 90'). Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. The pallet trucks may be manual or battery-powered. We ensure that we are affordable and always reliable, so you can always count on having the best experience when you service, buy or hire a forklift with us.</p>

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
