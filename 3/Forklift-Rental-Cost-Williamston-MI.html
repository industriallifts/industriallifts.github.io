Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>
<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
