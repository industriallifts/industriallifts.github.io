<p>Double Reach Trucks are commonly used in factory, food processing and general warehousing industries. Trying to lift loads too heavy for your forklift creates a great risk of a tip-over accident, this can also risk damaging product and plant facilities.

It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Sideloaders are trucks that operate by picking up their load from the side and travel parallel to the length of the load, from the perspective of the operator. An electronic narrow aisle forklift with an operator platform costs roughly $25,000 to $30,000. Ideal for lifting pallets and heavy loads, stacking in warehouses, loading and unloading trucks.
