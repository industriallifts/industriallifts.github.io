<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift. Its optimized design and quiet, stable mast allows for precise control of loads of all shapes and sizes, especially when used with a variety of attachments. OSHA tests you on properly driving forklifts. Product-line features: Each of the JCB rough-terrain forklifts is powered by a four-cylinder diesel engine generating 76 horsepower, driven for quick, smooth operation in all terrain by a JCB SyncroShuttle transmission.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
