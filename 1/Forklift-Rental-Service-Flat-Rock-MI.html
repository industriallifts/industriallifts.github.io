Choose machine category (petrol forklift, diesel, telescopic etc.), location, price range, manufacturer, production year and the seller, you want to buy the forklift from. Though moving away from the traditional LPG and diesel powered forklift is a major decision, electrics are associated with many advantages.</p>

While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
