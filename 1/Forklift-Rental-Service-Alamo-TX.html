When people think of forklifts, they usually imagine the small vehicle with two forks on the front that's used for lifting pallets.

<p>Due to this reason, we work hard to offer some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. Body lift kits are also typically the least expensive option when looking to lift a truck; however, a gap is created by the spacer between the body and frame.
