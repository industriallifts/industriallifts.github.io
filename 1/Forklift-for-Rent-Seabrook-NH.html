<p>Bobcat: Bobcat is one of the world's most recognized name brands in heavy equipment and it's easy to see why: they provide a wide range of machinery with rough terrain capability.

<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
