Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>
<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay. We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment. The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the forks the elevated until the point of intersection of the two load-carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor.</p>

<p>Linde is constantly developing its order pickers, aiming to make working conditions even safer and more ergonomic for operators, which is why, for example, the latest generation of order picking devices feature an even lower entry height. Infinitely variable lift and lower control provides smooth control for precise platform work.
