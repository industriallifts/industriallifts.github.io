<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice.

Order picker trucks are types of lift trucks that are controlled from a carriage wherein the operator stance can be found. They offer complete repair and maintenance services across most equipment makes and models. Some people will lift their trucks just for show, and that's cool if you do, we don't judge you.</p>
