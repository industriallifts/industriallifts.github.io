<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Straddle trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks and are used to carry long materials such as pipes, boards, and trees. To enable easy movement, the trucked equipped with 200 mm diameter, UHMW-PE steer wheels and UHMW-PE load rollers. The whole purpose of lifting a truck is to increase the size of tire that can be installed, especially since increasing tire size is the only true way of gaining ground clearance at the axle.</p>
