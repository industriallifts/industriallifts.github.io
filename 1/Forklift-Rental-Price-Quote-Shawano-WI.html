<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers.

Material handling is an essential business. As an operator of a counterbalance forklift, you could find yourself in many different types of workplaces; from constructions sites to ports, warehouses, storage yards and factories.</p>
