Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

The baselegs and stand-up configuration of the tractor allow reach trucks to be used in aisles as narrow as 9 feet. The other makes use of a see-through overhead guard, typically constructed from reinforced steel bars for safety, which provides a clear view of the forks and load overhead.</p>
