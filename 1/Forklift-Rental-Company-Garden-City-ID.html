<p>Buying a vehicle that has already been lifted will save the buyer the cost of the hardware, plus the labor charges of installing the lift kit. Linde offers many additional options for all pallet trucks. The AM 22 hand pallet truck is also available in low-noise form.

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
