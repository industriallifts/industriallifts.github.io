<p>The aim of our Industrial Counterbalance Forklift training course is to provide the candidate with the essential knowledge and skill to perform his tasks to the highest Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift training courses last between 1-5 days depending upon the requirements of the participants (refresher courses, intensive courses etc.), with partakers developing essential skills like machine operation, health and safety, and accepted good practice. There is a big difference between rough terrain forklifts and conventional forklifts. Forklifts are named after their fork-like prongs that lift up the load. If the employee was hired: The initial training and evaluation of that employee must be completed: Before December 1, 1999 By December 1, 1999 After December 1, 1999 Before the employee is assigned to operate a powered industrial truck.</p>

We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

Sit-down Forklift and Rider Pallet Jack experience is helpful. Workplace type and conditions are also factors in hazards commonly associated with powered industrial trucks. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
