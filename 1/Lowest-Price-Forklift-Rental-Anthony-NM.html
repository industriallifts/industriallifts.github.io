<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced â€” meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA. The growth of the region is due to the demand for modern material handling equipment across industries such as construction, mining, food, and beverage, etc. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>

New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget. Suspension lift kits are best for drivers who are avid off-roaders because they give you additional ground clearance. Industrial counterbalance forklifts can be used in a wide range of applications, like agricultural, beverage distribution and bottling, and retail industries.</p>
<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking. They are smaller than most forklifts and so are able to manoeuvre in those hard-to-reach areas. Forget parking garages, and height clearance could become an issue in some drive thrus. With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.
