A conveyor, overhead hoist, or equivalent material handling equipment shall be provided for handling batteries. Off-road forklifts are suitable for almost any environment (construction sites, docks, forests, etc.), they offer increased mobility and excellent results in areas where the terrain is rough. An unloaded forklift can also tip from the weight of the counterbalance, so safe driving is just ask important with an unloaded lift.</p>

Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
