<p>Counterbalance forklifts are probably the most common forklift trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores in the Vancouver area.

The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
<p>Other narrow aisle trucks include stand up straddles, swing masts, side loaders, and turret trucks. Lifting loads became an easier process, and the addition of a crane helped workers to pack forklifts quickly. The suspension lift kit helps drivers conquer uneven and off-road terrain.
