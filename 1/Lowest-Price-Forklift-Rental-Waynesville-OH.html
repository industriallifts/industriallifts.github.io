<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies. Should you operate forklift trucks you will be aware that all drivers need to be properly trained and certified. We're here to answer your questions and to finally put to rest which is better, a lifted truck or a lowered truck. Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>
<p>The following particularly applies to pallet trucks with a platform: Many ergonomic elements and functions make it easier to operate the truck. Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts. If you are unsure of what you want in a car, you need to create a shortlist of the trucks that appeal to you.</p>

Forklifts are mainly used for loading and unloading trucks and for carrying goods. Refresher training is required when there is a change in the workplace or type of truck being operated and for any operators found to be operating forklifts unsafely, those who have been involved or nearly involved in accidents or those who receive poor operation evaluations.</p>
<p>As long as the needs of your business fit the abilities and the strengths of the forklift, both the electric forklift and electric reach stacker can be extremely beneficial to your company. Suspension Lift Kit: If money's not an object and you want to go all out for a kit that lifts both your body and suspension for maximum off-road capabilities, a suspension lift kit is the way to go.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about lifted trucks but, simply put, they're not for everyone. Twin tube, monotube, and reservoir models are all available for anything you're taking on. For advanced off-roading rigs, we have you covered with shocks fitted for lifted suspensions as well as lift kits for DIY upgrades. Please note there will be an additional LO Licence processing fee payable to WorkSafe upon successful completion of your forklift training course.</p>

Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>This alone should be reason enough to ensure your operators are properly trained where safety and health regulations are involved. New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget. Suspension lift kits are best for drivers who are avid off-roaders because they give you additional ground clearance.
