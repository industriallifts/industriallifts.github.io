<p>This can occur if the forklift has loads that are over its designed capacity. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become. Self-driving forklifts, blockchain technology, ergonomic designs, virtual reality and lithium-ion batteries are all components of today's material handling equipment. In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
<p>The Industrial Truck Association has placed powered industrial trucks into 7 classes. Most kits include a standard or heavy duty compressor, a controller and all the hardware that you need to install the compressor onto your vehicle.

<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
