There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture.

Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>

If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
