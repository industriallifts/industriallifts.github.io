The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required.

Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below). Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. TPC Training's online and safety video training on Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>Most rough terrain forklifts have ergonomic controls for easy, intuitive use. The warehouse forklift has two subtypes: the side loader and the counterbalance forklift. Since the 1960s, Caterpillar has been producing forklift trucks designed to last, and built to perform in some of the toughest and harshest environments in the world. Order picker forklifts are specially designed devices that are used to optimize the speed and ease of picking stock from both sides of a warehouse aisle.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
