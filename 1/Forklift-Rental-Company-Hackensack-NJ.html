We're here to answer your questions and to finally put to rest which is better, a lifted truck or a lowered truck. Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>

<p>When it's time to choose a supplier for your forklift needs, it's important to know that they take your questions and concerns seriously.
